The libraries necessary to run my program are noted in the requirement.txt. If downloading tensorflow on a Mac, follow the installation guide on the tensorflow website (https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_mac) to avoid conflicts between the native python version and the python version that the user wants to run tensorflow with. 

Once all the libraries are downloaded, you are ready to run the program. Included in the folder is a pretrained model and sample images to run with the model. Simply run the predict.py in the terminal by inputting "python predict.py 'sample1.png'" or any other sample and the model should return the prediction for the number. If the user wants to test their own handwritten image, go to (https://www.youidraw.com/apps/painter/#) and open a new image with the dimensions 480x480 for most accurate predictions. After writing any MNIST number covering as much of the canvas as possible, export the png to the folder containing the predict.py and run "python predict.py (png name)" 

The other python folder is the code for creating, training, and saving a neural network machine learning model. If the user wants to train their own model simply run "python mnist.py". The accuracy and saved model file should be outputted, accuracy running somewhere around 96-97%. Note that after retraining the model and rewriting the pretrained model could render some of the sample png to not be accurately predicted as the pretrained.
